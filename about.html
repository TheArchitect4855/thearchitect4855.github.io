            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Kurtis Knodel. I was born in Burnaby, BC, Canada, on May 12<sup>th</sup> 2002.
                 After some moving around when I was young, myself and my family finally settled in Kelowna,
                 where I've lived and went to school ever since.

                Ever since I was young, I was amazed by computers. I thought they were the coolest thing, basically ever.
                 Finally, when I was 11 years old, I decided I wanted to make a video game. After a lot of "arguing" with
                 my parents, I convinced them to let me download Unity (then Unity3D) onto our home PC and give it a go.
                <h3>I fell in love.</h3>
                From there, I taught myself how to program, how to bend the computer to my will, and I made small games just for fun.
                 After that, I expanded my horizons into software development. When I was 16, I started freelancing to make some extra
                 cash, and in the years before that I would work on "revshare gamedev teams" just because I enjoyed it. When I was 15,
                 I worked on a "professional" team that almost got a publishing deal, but that fell apart pretty quick. I was skeptical
                 about it then, and to this day I still am. <br />
                Since then I've been doing freelancing and making games in my free time, and now I'm just about to start University to
                 study for a Computer Science degree.
